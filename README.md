# PowerShell-NAPS

This repo is what I worked on for my Windows server 2019 lab. I created a fake domain called notapornsite.com (NAPS) and made hundreds of user employees that I managed/audited with powershell scripts.

I find powershell to be a powerful and dangerous language that can do almost anything on a windows system. 
Security Professionals beware of powershell and its capabilities.
